Suppose that $\{ P_k^{[i]} \}_{k=0}^\infty$ for $i=1$ and
$2$ are two orthogonal families of monic polynomials such that
$\ps{p}{P_k^{[i]}}=0$ for all polynomial $p$ of degree less than $k$.
Given $k > 0$, we have that $P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]}$ is a polynomial
of degree $k-1$ because both polynomials are monic, such that
\[
  \ps{p}{P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]}}
  = \ps{p}{P_k^{[1]}} - \ps{p}{P_k^{[2]}} = 0
\]
for all polynomial $p$ of degree less than $k$.  In particular,
\[
  \ps{P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]}}{P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]}}
  = \int_a^b (P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]})^2 w(x) \dx{x} = 0 \ .
\]
Since $P_k^{[1]} - P_k^{[2]}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, we get that
$P_k^{[1]}(x) = P_k^{[2]}(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.

\solution{\SOL}{\ref{apprAQ2}}{
We have from Theorem~\ref{orthpoly} that (\ref{apprAQ2equ1}) is true
for some constants $A_k$, $B_k$ and $C_k$.  We only have to prove that
they have the form suggested in the question.  We also have from this
theorem that $\displaystyle A_k = \frac{a_{k+1,k+1}}{a_{k,k}}$ for
$k\geq 0$ and $\displaystyle C_k = \frac{A_k}{A_{k-1}}
= \frac{a_{k+1,k+1}a_{k-1,k-1}}{a_{k,k}^2}$ for $k >0$.  Because of
our choice for $a_{-1,-1}$, we also have $C_0 = 0$ as required.
Note that $\displaystyle A_k = \frac{a_{k+1,k+1}}{a_{k,k}}$ can
be easily proved by comparing the coefficient of
$x^{k+1}$ on both sides of (\ref{apprAQ2equ1}).

It remains only to prove that
\[
  B_k = \int_a^b xP_k^2(x)w(x) \dx{x} = \frac{a_{k,k-1}}{a_{k,k}}
- \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \ .
\]
Since
\begin{align*}
x P_k(x) &= \frac{a_{k,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} P_{k+1}(x) +
\frac{1}{a_{k,k}}
\left( a_{k,k-1} - \frac{a_{k,k}a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \right) P_k(x) + q(x) \\
&= \frac{a_{k,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} P_{k+1}(x) +
\left( \frac{a_{k,k-1}}{a_{k,k}} - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \right) P_k(x)
+ q(x) \ ,
\end{align*}
where $q$ is a polynomial of degree at most $k-1$, we have
\begin{align*}
B_k &= \int_a^b xP_k^2(x)w(x) \dx{x} \\
&= \int_a^b \left( \frac{a_{k,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} P_{k+1}(x) +
\left( \frac{a_{k,k-1}}{a_{k,k}} - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \right) P_k(x)
+ q(x)\right) P_k(x)w(x) \dx{x} \\
&= \frac{a_{k,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}}
\underbrace{\int_a^b  P_{k+1}(x) P_k(x)w(x) \dx{x}}_{=0}
+ \left( \frac{a_{k,k-1}}{a_{k,k}} - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \right)
\underbrace{\int_a^b  P_k^2(x) w(x) \dx{x}}_{=1} \\
& \qquad  + \underbrace{\int_a^b q(x) P_k(x)w(x) \dx{x}}_{=0}
= \left( \frac{a_{k,k-1}}{a_{k,k}} - \frac{a_{k+1,k}}{a_{k+1,k+1}} \right) \ .
\end{align*}
